# wii-balance-board-recorder
This is a Windows operating application to calibrate and collect data from a Wii Balance Board through its bluetooth connection. Please refer to the wiki of this repository or the pdf manual (inside folder: manual) for further instructions.

## Contributions
This application was build and is maintained by Vincent Tuinder from the Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. He asked me to upload and maintain the GitHub repository. 

## Getting started
To use the Wii Balance Recorder application, click the green 'code' button above. Then choose 'download as ZIP'. Unzip the folder and start up the installation procedures by clicking the .exe file. For further instructions how to use the software and calibrate the Wii Balance Board, refer to the github wiki or the pdf inside the folder 'manual'. 

## Posturography
Once the Wii Balance Board is connected and the software is installed, one can obtain a .CSV file (tab delimited) to analyse, for example, the Center of Pressure (COP) of a human performing a balance task. To select a segment and analyze frequently used COP parameters, one may use the application supplied here: <https://github.com/tomvredeveld/center-of-pressure-analysis-tool> 

## Contact
